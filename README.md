Hello dear friends👋,
In this new repositories that I opened, I'm going to share with you most of the code that I've used for practice and the projects I've worked on, and among these codes, we'll have both regular short codes and long codes that are useful.
Thank you for your attention(German:Vielen Dank für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit.),🙏.
