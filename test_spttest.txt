Title: Character Counting Program With Unit Tests In Python

Description:
This Project Includes Two Python Files:

1. spttest.py
   - Contains The Function 'countc(s, c)'
   - This Function Counts How Many Times The Character 'c' Appears In The String 's'.
   - It Loops Through Each Character In The String And Increments A Counter When A Match Is Found.
   - The Function Is Case-Sensitive(Meaning 'A' And 'a' Are Different).

2. test_spttest.py
   - Contains Unit Tests For The 'countc' Function Using Python's Built-In 'unittest' Module.
   - Tests Include Checking:
       * Counting Existing Characters
       * Handling Characters That Do Not Appear
       * Case Sensitivity(Uppercase Vs Lowercase)
       * Empty String Input
       * Special Characters

How To Run:

1. Make Sure Both Files('spttest.py' And 'test_spttest.py')Are In The Same Directory.
2. Open Terminal Or Command Prompt.
3. Navigate To That Directory.
4. To Run The Tests, Execute:

    python -m unittest test_spttest.py

   Or Simply:

    python test_spttest.py

Requirements:
- Python 3.6 Or Newer
- No Additional Libraries Required

Example Usage:

In 'spttest.py' You Can Use The Function Like This:

    print(countc("banana", "a"))   # Output: 3
    print(countc("hello", "z"))    # Output: 0

Notes:
- The Function Is Case-Sensitive.
- The Tests Ensure That The Function Works Correctly For Different Cases.

Thank You.
